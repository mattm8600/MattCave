**Definition:** Vectors $\vec u$ and $\vec v$ are **orthogonal** if $\vec u \cdot \vec v = 0$

Orthogonal Component: L = W perp, W = L perp

- The orthogonal component of the row space of A → Nul A
- Orthogonal component of Column space of A → Nul $A^T$

### Orthogonal Sets
A set where each vector is orthogonal to each other (each combination of vectors dot out to zero)
- This set is linearly independent by definition (can be a basis if it spans something)

### Orthogonal Projection
We can break a vector into two parts: A $z$ vector that represents the perpendicular component and a $\hat y$ component that represents the parallel component with respect to the surface

$\hat y$ is the orthogonal projection of $y$ onto non-zero vector $u$  
$z$ is the component of $y$ orthogonal to $u$

### $\hat y =$ $proj_L \vec y = \frac{\vec y \cdot \vec u}{\vec u \cdot \vec u}\vec u$
