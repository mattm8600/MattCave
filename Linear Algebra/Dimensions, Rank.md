### Dimensions

**Definition:** The *dimensions* of  [[Vector Spaces]] are the number of [[Basis]] vectors they have.

If a vector space $V$ is spanned by an infinite set, then V is **infinite dimensional**
If a vector space $V$ is spanned by a finite set, then V is **finite dimensional**

A [[Subspace]] of any vector space will have a dimension that is less than or equal to the vector space


### Rank/Nullity
**Definition:** The *rank* of an $m \times n$ matrix A is the dimension of the [[Column Space]] and the *nullity* of A is the dimension of the [[Null space]]

Rank → The # of pivot columns in a matrix
Nullity → The number of free variables
Therefore: rank A + nullity A = number of columns in A
