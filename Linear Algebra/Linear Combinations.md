MATRIX REVIEW: An **n x m** matrix has *n* rows and *m* columns
An $n \times 1$ matrix represents a vector (in linear algebra)

#### A **linear Combination** is a combination of vectors with weights:
#### $\vec y = C_1v_1 + â€¦ + c_pv_p$
which is equivalent to the matrix:
$\begin{bmatrix}C_1 & ... & C_n & b\end{bmatrix}$ 
^ Wow we can row reduce and solve this!
