A **subspace** is any set $H$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ that has three properties:
1. The zero vector is in $H$
2. For each $\vec u$ and $\vec v$ in $H$, the sum $\vec u + \vec v$ is in $H$
3. For each $\vec u$ in $H$ and each scalar $c$, the vector $c\vec u$ is in $H$

Aka must have the zero vector, have closure through addition, and closure through multiplication![[Pasted image 20221218141619.png]]
Exs:
- A plane is a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^3$
- A line is a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^4$
