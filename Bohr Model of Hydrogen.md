An atom radiates energy only when an electron makes a transition from an orbit of energy $E_i$ to a **lower** energy level $E_f$
- Electron dropping to a lower level → Emits a photon with energy
- Electron raising to a higher level → Absorbing an electron with energy

Found that there are different electron orbits - signified by **principal quantum number**
- Radius of orbit n → $r_n$
- Speed of electron in orbit n → $v_n$

### Angular Momentum of Electron: $L_n = mv_nr_n = n\frac{h}{2\pi}$
– where $m$ = electron mas

### Radius of nth orbit: $r_n = n^2a_0$
where $a_0$ is the **Bohr radius = 5.29E-11**

### Velocity of nth orbit: $v_n = \frac{1}{\epsilon_0} \frac{e^2}{2nh}$
– where $e$ is magnitude of electron charge

### Energy for nth orbit in Bohr Model: $E_n = -\frac{hcR}{n^2}$
where $R$ = 1.097E7
