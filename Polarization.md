**Polarization** is when light is restricted to a single plane
**Unpolarized Light:** Light has tons of photons in random directions (like normal light)

Direction of light polarization is the **direction of the E-Field** (perpendicular to propagation)

## Polarizing Light
- When Light is polarized for the first time: $I = I_0/2$
- otherwise use $I = I_0 cos^2\phi$

Light can also be polarized by reflection at one particular angle (**polarizing angle**) (see [[Law of Reflection]])
Brewsterâ€™s Law: $tan \theta_p = \frac{n_b}{n_a}$
- Works because reflected and refracted rays are perpendicular to each other
