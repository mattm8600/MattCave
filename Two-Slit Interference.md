Has an approximate path difference of $r_2 - r_1 = dsin \theta$

When you can use small angle approximation $sin \theta = \frac{y}{R}$

### Constructive [[Interference]]: $dsin\theta = m\lambda$
- Y positions of constructive interference: $y_m = R \frac{m\lambda}{d}$

### Destructive Interference: $dsin\theta = (m + \frac{1}{2})\lambda$
