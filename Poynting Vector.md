Flow of energy in an EM wave is measured by the **poynting vector:**  
## $\vec S = \frac{1}{\mu_0} \vec E \times \vec B$
The magnitude of the average value of $\vec S$ is the intensity:
## $I = S_{av} = \frac{E_{max}B_{max}}{2 \mu_0}$
^ Use the EM Wave equation to solve for other permutations of eq (see [[Electromagnetic Waves]])
