- Exponential Tech → Tech that feeds on itself to exponentially grow and develop

## Important Frameworks
1. Great Game of Power (At a civilization level)
	– Criteria to participate: Nuclear capability, influence on other powers, dominating exponential tech
	– Strategic Actors: Hyper agents, Institutions
	– Think of it like a game of civ
2. Multipolar Traps (I have to do it or someone else will)
	–  Having to abuse a perverse incentive because otherwise someone else does and beats you
	– Security and risk are central to this (Over assessment of risk especially)
3. Types of Structure (General categories that selection takes place)
	– Infrastructure
	– Social Structure
	– Super structure → Shared values, culture, spirituality
	– All of these are interconnected

Catastrophic Risks:
- Nuclear War
- Climate Change and Environmental Issues
- Fields of Exponential Tech
- Intersection of economic growth and planetary boundaries

Meta-Crisis → Connectedness of all these aforementioned risks

Do we have the power of Gods without the wisdom of Gods?

### Our Two Current Attractors:
1. Catastrophe → Slow and decentralized decision-making, destructive power in too many hands
2. Dystopia → Centralized and fast choice-making, no individual freedom

### The Third Attractor Criteria:
- Able to prevent all human induced catastrophe
- Coherent choice making factoring total intelligence with speed of small # of people
- Harmonizing hyperagency and focus on collective wellbeing
- Has to be on all three levels
- Systems of collective intelligence and education is probably the best solution
