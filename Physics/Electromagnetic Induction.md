Magnetic fields can induce a current through a circuit
- Electromagnetic induction is dependent on the rate of change of [[Magnetic Flux]]

## EMF induced on a Moving Conductor
You can change the magnetic flux through a surface by changing the area, as in this example:

Using Faradayâ€™s Law the induced emf for this loop is:
## $$ \epsilon = \frac{BdA}{dt} = \frac{Blvdt}{dt} =Blv$$
where $l$ is the width of the conductor

The emf induced on a conductor moving in a magnetic field is called motional emf
