#Physics 
The distances of the images are related to the radius

## Image Distances: $$\frac{1}{s} + \frac{1}{s'} = \frac{2}{R} = \frac{1}{f}$$
Image is always positive (**real image**) for spherical mirrors

$f$ → **focal length**, the distance from the vertex to the focal point
Focal point → Where the rays converge to

Images are always inverted when the radius is positive (like this example)
