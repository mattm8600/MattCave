#Physics
**Like** magnetic moles **repel** each other, **unlike** magnetic poles **attract** each other

**Units:** Tesla (T) 

### Magnetic Force on a Moving Charge:$$ \vec F = q \vec v \times  \vec B$$
q = Particle’s Charge
v = particle’s velocity
B = magnetic field

Particles moving parallel to magnetic field experience **zero** magnetic force

## Electric Current and Magnetism
Electric current produces a magnetic field!

A charge moving at right angles to a uniform B field moves in a **Circle** at a constant speed because F and V are perpendicular
- Relate magnetic force to centripetal force: $qvB = mv^2/r$

– When v is not perpendicular to B → Charge moves in a helical path

## Charged Particles in E and B fields
In many applications, charged particles move in the presence of both electric and magnetic fields
- Apply Newton’s Second Law: $F = qE + qV \times B$ 
	– Particles moves in a straight line for $V = E/B$

**J.J. Thompson q/m experiment:**
- Shot a beam of electrons, used magnetic field until the field is straight
- Determine where $V = E/B$ 
- Then turn off B and measure $\Delta y$ to determine $q/m$
