A changing current in one circuit must induce an emf in a nearby circuit → Mutual Inductance
	– Or induce an emf in itself → Self Inductance (according to [[Lenz’s Law]], [[Faraday’s Law]])

**Unit:** The Henry (H) is the unit of inductance kg m^2 s^-2 A^-2
## Mutual Inductance:
If two coils of wire are placed near each other, a changing current in one will induce an emf in the other

Flux is due to current $I_1$ in Coil 1
## $\epsilon_2 = \frac{-Mdi_1}{dt}$ and $\epsilon_1 = \frac{-Mdi_2}{dt}$ where $M_{21} = \frac{N_2 \Phi _{21}}{I_1}$
While this looks confusing it is basically parameterizing the change in flux into change in current
– The mutual inductance created by coil 1 on coil 2

If you set the mutual inductance of both equal to each other: 
$$M = \frac{N_2 \Phi_2}{i_1} = \frac{N_1 \Phi_1}{i_2} $$

## Self-Inductance
Current doesn’t reach its maximum value immediately when a switch is closed
The change in current causes a magnetic flux
- This flux creates an induced emf opposing the batteries
### Self Inductance of a coil $$ L = \frac{N \Phi_b}{i}$$
L → Self Inductance (depends on geometry of the coil and physical characteristics)

Inductors are added as part of electrical power transmission systems to suppress any rapid changes in current

## Inductors in Circuits: $V = L \frac {dI}{dt}$
- When $I$ is constant → the emf created is zero
- When $I$ is increasing → Inductor creates a positive emf
- When $I$ is decreasing → Inductor creates a negative emf
