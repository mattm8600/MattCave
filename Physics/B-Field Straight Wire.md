Integrate over wire using the Biot-Savart Law

For a short wire: $$\frac{\mu_0 I}{4 \pi} \frac{1}{R}(sin \theta_2 - sin \theta_1)$$
Where $\theta$ is the angle from the point to both ends of the wire

INFINITE WIRE:
# $$ B = \frac{\mu_0I}{2\pi R}$$
$B$ → Magnetic Field of wire
$\mu_0$ → Permeability Constant = $4pi* 10^{-7}$ H/m
R → Distance from R
