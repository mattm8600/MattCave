#Physics 

Consider a current loop at an angle in a magnetic field: (see [[Magnetic Field and Forces]])

- The direction of the current (different for each side) cause different magnetic forces
	– In this example: Side B’s forces cancel out
	– Side a’s forces apply a torque to the loop that spins it 

# $\vec \tau = \vec \mu \times \vec B$ where $\vec \mu = IA$

$\vec \tau$ → Vector Magnetic Torque on current loop
$\vec \mu$ → Magnetic Dipole Moment (points in direction of normal vector to loop)
$\vec B$ → Magnetic Field

## Potential Energy
The potential energy of the loop depends on its orientation in the field
- When $\mu$ points in the same direction as $\vec B$ there is only potential energy $$ U = -\vec \mu \cdot \vec B = -\vec \mu \vec B cos(\theta)$$
## Applications
**Electric Motors** uses torque on a current loop in a magnetic field to turn magnetic energy into kinetic energy

Generates act as the opposite of a motor. They have a gas engine spin a loop in a magnetic field which turns mechanical energy into electrical energy
