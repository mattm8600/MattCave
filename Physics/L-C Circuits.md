Energy oscillates from the Capacitor to the Inductor and vice versa

![[Pasted image 20221215225840.png]]
- As capacitor discharges → Energy stored in electric field decreases
- Current causes energy to be stored in the magnetic field of inductor
	– Energy transferred from electric to magnetic field
- Current goes in opposite direction recharging capacitor
^ Cycles like this (assuming no resistance or energy loss to radiation)

## Energy: $$U = U_c + U_L = \frac{Q^2}{2C} + \frac{1}{2}LI^2 $$
$U_c$ → Energy on capacitor
$U_L$ → Energy on Inductor
- Magnitude of energy is constant

## Charge in L-C: $Q = Q_{max} cos(\omega t)$
## Current in L-C: $I = -\omega Q_{max} sin(\omega t)$
- $I$ is derivative of Charge

## where $\omega = \frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}}$
