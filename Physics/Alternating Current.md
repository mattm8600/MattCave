#Physics 

An **AC Source** is a device that supplies a sinusoidally varying voltage $\upsilon = Vcos \omega t$
where:
- $\upsilon$ is instantaneous voltage
- V is voltage frequency
- $\omega =2 \pi f$
from that: $i = Icos\omega t$

### Root-Mean-Square Values
**RMS** values are an approximation for the forward voltage in an ac current
$I_{rms} = \frac{I}{\sqrt2}$ and $V_{rms} = \frac{V}{\sqrt2}$  

## Phase Differences of Components
- Resistor current is in phase
- Inductance current is -90 out of phase
- Capacitor current is +90 out of phase

Reactance - AC Equivalent of resistance (Unit: Ohms)

## AC Inductors
Stores energy temporarily in magnetic field and then releases back to emf source
## $V_0 = I_0X_L$
where
## $X_L = \omega L$

## AC Capacitance
- Current in capacitor flows continuously charging and discharging in one direction, then next
## $V_0 = I_0 X_c$
where
## $X_C = \frac{1}{\omega C}$

^ Voltage equations apply for RMS too

# Power: $P = I_{rms}V_{rms}$
