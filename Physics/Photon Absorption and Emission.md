Consider a container of gases: each atom is at the ground energy level
- If we shine light of frequency f on the container, an atom can absorb one of the photons provided by the [[Photons]] energy $E=hf$

#### Spontaneous Emission:
Excited atoms can return to the ground level by emitting a photon with the same frequency they absorbed
– This is spontaneous emission
– Direction and phase of photons are random

#### Stimulated Emission:
Shoot a second photon at all the excited atoms → resonance effect causes them to emit photons with the same frequency, direction, phase, and polarization
- LASERS!!!!!!! (literally an acronym for light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation)
