Events are not simultaneous across different inertial reference frames:
– Think of lightning striking both sides of a train car going near the speed of light

## Lorentz Factor: $$ \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-u^2/c^2}}$$

NOTE: Lorentz Factor is **greater** than 1 for all values (because u is less than c)

## Time Dilation: $\Delta t = \gamma \Delta t_0$
$\Delta t$ → Time interval between events measured in second frame of reference
$\Delta t’$ → Proper time between two events measured in rest frame (where object seems at rest)
$\gamma$ → Lorentz Factor
- For someone traveling close to the speed of light, time moves faster (ex: might take 5 years to get somewhere from their pov but 10 from a frame at rest)


## Length Contraction: $l = \frac{l}{\gamma}$ 
- Since rest frame’s perception of time changes, their perception of length must also change
- Length is perceived as less the faster you go (makes sense because time feels faster) compared to frame at rest
- There is no length contraction perpendicular to relative motion

## Relativistic Momentum: $\vec p = \gamma m \vec v$

## Relativistic Work and Energy:
Kinetic Energy = $(\gamma -1)mc^2$
Rest Energy = $mc^2$

Total Energy = $KE + mc^2 = \gamma mc^2$

### $E^2 = (mc^2)^2 + (pc)^2$
^ Energy in terms of momentum and rest energy
- Photons have no mass so their energy just is the momentum portion
