When you get close to the speed of light, the [[Galilean Coordinate Transformation]] breaks
– The **Lorentz Transformation** takes [[special relativity]] into account for distance, time, and velocity
- The time dilation and length contraction formulas are simplified versions of Lorentz

## $x' = \gamma(x-ut)$
## $t' = \gamma(t-ux/c^2)$

### Lorentz Transformation for **Velocities:** $$v_x' = \frac{v_x - u}{1-uv_x/c^2} $$
for two different reference frames S and S’ (no distinction between them)
