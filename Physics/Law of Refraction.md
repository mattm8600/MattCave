The index of Refraction is a material property $n$ that comes from the equation $n = c/v$
	– Since f is the same in any material this causes the wavelength to reduce
	$\lambda = \frac{\lambda_0}{n}$


## Law of Refraction: $n_asin \theta_a = n_b sin \theta_b$
– where $n_a$ is the index of refraction for the first surface (where the wave comes from)
– and $n_b$ is the index of refraction for the second surface (where the wave enters)

## Dispersion
The value of n isn’t constant for all wavelengths → it tends to decrease with increasing wavelengths
- Result: Sometimes different wavelengths of light separate, which is called **dispersion**
