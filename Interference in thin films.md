Light reflects from the upper and lower surfaces of the film, undergoing [[interference]]

The interference depends on the phase shift of the light:
- Case 1: $n_a$ > $n_b$ → No interference
- Case 2: $n_a = n_b$ → No reflection at all
- Case 3: $n_a$ < $n_b$ → Reflected wave with a half-cycle phase shift (180 degrees)

Ex:

Glass has a greater index of refraction than air, therefore:
- The left wave is Case 1 because it goes from a greater n to a lesser one
- The right wave is Case 3 then case 1 (it goes from air to glass which is from lesser to greater)
^ This means that this has a phase shift of a half cycle

## With No Phase shift
- Constructive Reflection → $2t = m \lambda$
- Destructive Reflection → $2t = (m + \frac{1}{2})\lambda$

## With Half Cycle Phase Shift
- Constructive Reflection → $2t = (m + \frac{1}{2})\lambda$
- Destructive Reflection → $2t = m \lambda$

### Non-Reflective Coating:
Makes sure both wavelengths cancel out (does Case 3 twice to have two half cycle phase shifts)

- Usually film is around $\lambda/4$ think
