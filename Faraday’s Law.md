#Physics 

**Faraday’s Law:** The EMF induced in a circuit is directly proportional to the time rate of change of the magnetic flux through the circuit.

# Equation $$ \epsilon = \frac{-Nd\phi_B}{dt} = \frac{-NdBdA}{dt}$$
N = is the number of coils (if there is more than one)
- The induced emf will counteract the change in magnetic flux (see [[Lenz’s Law]])
