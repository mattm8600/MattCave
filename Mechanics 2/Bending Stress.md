**Bending stress** (aka flexural stress) is the stress created by the internal bending moment on a beam
- Makes up most real world failures

Note the sign conventions of bending stress:

- Positive Bending Moment → Top is in compression, Bottom is in tension
- Negative Bending Moment → Top is in tension, Bottom is in compression

## Formula:
# $\sigma = \frac{-M_z}{I_{zc}}c$
- $M$ is the bending moment (from moment diagram)
- $I$ is the moment of inertia perpendicular to the plane of bending
- $c$ is the vertical distance above the neutral axis
	– The greatest distance from the centroid to the edge
