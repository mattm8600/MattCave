If you draw your shear line at the joint between two parts, you can look at the [[Direct Shear Stress]]
- In real life fasteners are used to deal with this stress

Consider Nails that have a max force ($F_{nail}$) they can withstand before failure

We can find the spacing required between a set of nails to withstand the shear stress:
# $s=\frac{nF_{nail}I}{VQ}$
where
- $s$ is the spacing between nails
- $n$ is the number of nails through the shear line
- $F_{nail}$ is the max allowable shear force the nail can withstand without failing

Steps:
1. Draw shear line through juncture
2. Calculate $Q$ (and $V$ if not given to you)
