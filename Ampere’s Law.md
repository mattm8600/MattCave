#Physics 

**Definition:** Relates the tangential component $B_t$ of the magnetic field integrated around a closed curve C to the enclosed that passes through any surface bound by C

# Equation:$$ \oint \vec B \cdot d \vec l = \mu_0I_{enc} $$

Example Derivation of Infinite Wire using Ampere’s Law:
$\vec B \cdot \vec l = \mu_0I_{enc}$
$\vec B \cdot 2 \pi r = \mu_0 I$
$\vec B = \frac{\mu_0I}{2 \pi r}$

## Capacitor Case of Ampere’s Law:
 For a charging capacitor: For an Ampere’s Surface through only one of the plates shows a current of zero
- We know there’s a current as the capacitor is charging
- In this case we use a **displacement current** a fake current between the region
$$ i_D = \epsilon \frac{d \Phi_E}{dt}$$
^Plug that in for enclosed current in this case
