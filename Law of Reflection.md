#Physics 

When light hits a surface it’s partially reflected and refracted
- Ex: Window → You can see a reflection, and you can see people inside


# Equation: $\theta_r = \theta_a$
where $\theta_r$ = angle of reflection and $theta_a$ = Angle of incidence

## Total Internal Reflection
When all of the refraction is equal to 90 degrees aka no refraction only reflection
**NOTE:** $n_b$ must be less than $n_a$

### Equation: $\sin \theta_{crit} = \frac{n_b}{n_a}$
