**Definition:** a set of vectors is said to be *linearly independent* if none of the vectors are a linear combination of each other
Equation:
### $x_1v_1 + x_2v_2 + ... + x_pv_p = \vec 0$
(has only the trivial solution to [[The Matrix Equation]])


## Linear Dependence

#### There is a nontrivial solution to $c_1v_1 + ... + c_pv_p = \vec 0$
- This means that (at least) one of the vectors is a linear combination of the others
- They are also linearly independent if one is a scalar multiple of another
- If the zero vector is in the set it is linearly dependent

## Ex:

- Since there are no free variables, it means that there is only the trivial solution
	â€“ This means that the system of equations is **linearly independent**

You can also tell if a set is linearly dependent by the # of vectors in it
- If the number of vectors is greater than there are entries in the vector the set is linearly dependent
