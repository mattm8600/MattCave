**EM Spectrum:** All the possible wavelengths and frequencies for EM Waves
	– A changing electric field produces a magnetic field
	– A changing magnetic field produces an electric field
- Sinusoidally created magnetic and electric fields can propagate on their own

Plane wave → Fields are uniform over planes perpendicular to propagation

### Properties:
- EM waves are transverse
- Waves travel with definite unchanging speed
- Don’t need a medium

Using [[Faraday’s Law]] we can derive for an EM wave in a vacuum: $$E_{max} = cB_{max{}} $$
- Using this equation and an [[Ampere’s Law]] derivation we can calculate the speed of light
Also: $B = \epsilon_0 \mu_0 c E$

## Treating EM waves sinusoidally:
### $\vec E(x,t) = \hat{j}E_{max} cos(kx- \omega t)$
### $\vec B(x,t) = \hat{k}B_{max}cos(kx- \omega t)$
^ For a wave propagating in the x-direction
Remember: $k = \frac{2 \pi}{\lambda}$ and $\omega = 2 \pi f$
- You can use $c = \lambda f$ for these too

## EM Waves in Matter:
Acts like they are using a dialetric $$ \upsilon = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\epsilon \mu}} = \frac{c}{\sqrt{KK_m}}$$
where:
$\epsilon$ is Permittivity
$\mu$ is permeability
K is dialetric constant
$K_M$ is Relative Permeability

## EM Standing Waves
- If EM Waves are reflected by a conductor they can superimpose and create standing waves
- **Nodes** are when $\vec E =0$ (usually when $x=0, \frac{\lambda}{2}, \lambda, \frac{3\lambda}{2})$
- **Antinodes** are when $\vec B = 0$ (usually when $x = \frac{\lambda}{4}, \frac{3\lambda}{4}$ , etc)
Use $\lambda_n = \frac{2L}{n}$ when in a cavity (think back to instruments)
