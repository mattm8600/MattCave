# Matt Cave 3.0
Hi! Welcome to Matt's (hopefully) documentation of notes. We are going to compile everything I learn for the rest of college into this notes graph, so I can access it much more easily down the line. Hopefully I won't have to google literally everything!!!

## Subjects
1. [[Computer Science]]
2. [[Mechanical Engineering]]
3. [[Physics]]
4. [[Math]]

Those topics will be split into different individual classes and what I learned in them.


Idea for Daily planner
- Need the tasks to do today in table
- Need a weekly calendar that you can scroll through
- Need to be able to add tasks and dates for completion
