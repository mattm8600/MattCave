An **orthonormal set** is an orthogonal set of unit vectors. If the set spans something, then they become an orthonormal basis. (see [[Orthogonal Sets]])

You can make an orthogonal set into an orthonormal set by scaling the vectors, so their magnitudes are all 1

**Thm:** An $m \times n$ matrix $U$ has orthonormal columns iff $U^TU = I$
