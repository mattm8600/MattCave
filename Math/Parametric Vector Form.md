A way of describing a solution to [[The Matrix Equation]] as a vector and a parametric vector

### Steps:
1. Row reduce and find the solution to the system
2. Put basic variables in terms of free variables
3. Write the variable vector with basic vectors in terms of free vectors
4. Break up variable vector into constants and parameterized free vectors



### Ex:

And then break it up until terms of constants and free variables
