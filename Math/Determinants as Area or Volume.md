[[Determinants]] also describe geometric properties in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and $\mathbb{R}^3$

The determinant of a $2 \times 2$ matrix is the **area** of the parallelogram determined by the matrix
- Parallelogram, where each column represents a vector (use unit vectors for x and y to test)

The determinant of a $3 \times 3$ matrix is the **volume** of the **parallelepiped** determined by the matrix
- Where each column represents a 3d vector
