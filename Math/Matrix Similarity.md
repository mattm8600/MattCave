**Similar Matrices** are almost like saying two matrices are row-equivalent. They share lots of important properties:
- Have the same rank
- Have the same determinant
- Have the same eigenvalues

**Definition:** If two $n \times n$ matrices satisfy this equation with some matrix $P$, then they are similar.
## $B = P^{-1} A P$
