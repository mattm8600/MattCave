Polynomials of $n$ degrees always have $n$ roots
	– Some of them may just be complex

## $\vec x = Re(\vec x) + iIm(\vec x)$

Complex eigenvectors come in pairs (as shown in the example)

Real of first then imaginary of second
For D → Real in top and bottom corners, imag on the right and left top/bottom
