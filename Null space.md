The **null space** of a matrix A is the set Nul A of all solutions to the homogeneous equation $A\vec x = \vec 0$ 
- Intuitively: The set of all vectors that become 0 when a transformation is applied to them

To find the basis for a null space: Set $A\vec x = \vec 0$, row reduce, and put the basic variables in terms of free variables. These vectors you get are your [[Basis]]

Notes:
- $\vec u$, $\vec v$, and $\vec w$ are automatically linearly independent
- the # of spanning vectors equals the number of free variables

## Applications with Linear Transformations
The **null space** of a linear transformation is the set of all $\vec u$ such that $T(\vec u) = \vec 0$
