#Physics 

Acts like a damped harmonic oscillator (Like  [[L-C Circuits]] but energy is being taken out)

## Charge: $Q = Q_{max} e^{-Rt/2L}cos \omega_dt$
### $$\omega_d = [\frac{1}{LC}-(\frac{R}{2L})^2]^\frac{1}{2}$$
### Time Constant: $\tau = 2\frac{L}{R}$




depending on the value of $\omega$, the circuit will damp differently

If $R = \sqrt{4L/C}$ → $\omega = 0$ the circuit stops oscillating and just decays (**Critical Damping**)
- If R > Critical Damping → Over damped
- If R < Critical Damping → Under damped
