Second application for First Order Ordinary Differential Equations. Considers models of population dynamics governed by first-order equations of this form:
## $\frac{dp}{dt} = R(p)p-h(t)$
- $p(t)$ is the size of population as a function of time
- R(p) models the growth rate of the population as a function of $p$
- $h(t)$ is the harvest rate due to predators (rate population decreases per time increment)
