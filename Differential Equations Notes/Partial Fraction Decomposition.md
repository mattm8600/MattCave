This is a way of splitting a fraction into multiple fractions of different factors.
- Used to break fractions into simpler parts

### Process:
1. Factor the denominator
2. Write one partial fraction for each of these factors
3. Follow this process to solve for each of the constants:
	– Multiply the denominators that you aren't solving for
	– Plug in the root for the constant you are solving for
	- The solution to this is the coefficient for that fraction

## Example: $\frac{1}{4y-y^3}$
Denominators have three factors → $y$, $2-y$, $2+y$
Setup into this form
## $\frac{A}{y}+\frac{B}{2-y}+\frac{C}{2+y}$
Solve for A:
## $A = \frac{1}{(2-y)(2+y)}\vert_{0}$
