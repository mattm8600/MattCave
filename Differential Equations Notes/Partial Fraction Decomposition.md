This is a way of splitting a fraction into multiple fractions of different factors.
- Used to break fractions into simpler parts

### Process:
1. Factor the denominator
2. Write one partial fraction for each of these factors
3. Follow this process to solve for each of the constants:
	– Multiply the denominators that you aren't solving for
	– Plug in the root for the constant you are solving for
	- The solution to this is the coefficient fo rtha
