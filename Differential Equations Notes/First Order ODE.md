A **First Order ODE** follows the form:
## $\frac{dy}{dt}+a(t)y(t)=b(t)$

There are three cases to consider when solving these:
1. $a(t)=0$
2. $b(t)=0$
3. Neither equal 0


Note: The **Integrating factor** is the following:
## $e^{\int a(t)dt}$

### Neither Equal 0
Steps:
1. Multiply both sides by the integrating factor
2. Put in the form $\frac{d}{dt}(...)=g(t)$
3. Integrate both sides
4. Solve
