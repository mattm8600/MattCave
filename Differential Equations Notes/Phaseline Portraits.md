For [[Autonomous ODE]]s and [[Nonautonomous ODE]] we can represent the solutions in a phase line portrait. This is because stationary solutions can be represented as vertical asymptotes.
- Allows you to get around solving the equation as well

### Process:
1. Find stationary solutions
2. Find any holes that exist
3. Find the sign in between each of the stationary solutions
4. Find out if the stationary solutions are stable, unstable, or semi-stable

### Stable, Unstable, Semi-stable
- **Stable** → If the solutions are trending towards a stationary solution
	– A positive on left side and negative on right side of stat. soln.
- **Unstable** → Solutions trending away from a stationary solution
	– A negative on the left and positive on the right of stat. soln.
- **Semi-Stable** → Solution trends past a stationary solution
	– Same signs on both sides of stationary solution
