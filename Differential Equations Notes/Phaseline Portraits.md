For [[Autonomous ODE]]s and [[Nonautonomous ODE]] we can represent the solutions in a phase line portrait. This is because stationary solutions can be represented as vertical asymptotes.
- Allows you to get around solving the equation as well

### Process:
1. Find stationary solutions
2. Find any holes that exist
3. Find the sign in between each of the stationary solutions
4. Find out if the stationary solutions are stable, unstable, or semi-stable

### Stable, Unstable, Semi-stable
- **Stable** â†’
