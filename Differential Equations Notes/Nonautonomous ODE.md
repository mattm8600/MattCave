These Differential Equations follow the form:
## $\frac{dy}{dt} = f(t)g(y)$
- Note: [[Autonomous ODE]]s are a special case of this where $g(y)$ is a constant 
- There are two different types of stationary solutions â†’ $f(t)=0$ or $g(y)=0$

Stationary Solution for $f(t)$ :
- $f(t)$ does not exist
- $f$ is not continuous around $t$

Stationary Solution for $g(y)$ :
- $g(y)$ does not exist
- $g$ is not continuous at $y$
- $g(y)=0$,
