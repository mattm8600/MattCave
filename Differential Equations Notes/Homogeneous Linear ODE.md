The homogeneous [[Linear ODE]] means that $f(t) = 0$ 
Therefore this is the form:
## $\frac{dy}{dt} +a(t)=0$

The solution is:
## $y = e^{-A(t)}+C$ where $Aâ€™(t) = a(t)$

(Insert proof from class notes)

### Ex:
Find the general solution for $\frac{dp}{dt} = 5p$ 
1. Put solution into general linear form: $\frac{dp}{dt}$
