The homogeneous [[Linear ODE]] means that $f(t) = 0$ 
Therefore this is the form:
## $\frac{dy}{dt} +a(t)=0$

The solution is:
## $y = e^{-A(t)}c$ where $Aâ€™(t) = a(t)$

(Insert proof from class notes)

### Ex:
Find the general solution for: 
### $\frac{dp}{dt} = 5p$ 
1. Put solution into general linear form: $\frac{dp}{dt} - 5p= 0$
2. Solve for $A(t)$ by integrating $a(t)$: $A(t) = -5t$
3. Put the solution into general form:
### $p=e^{5t}c$

- Note: This is just a special case of [[Nonhomogeneous 1st Order ODE]]
