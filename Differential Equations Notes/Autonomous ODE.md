**Autonomous Ordinary Differential Equations** are when $f(t)$ is constant
## $\frac{dy}{dt} = g(y)$
- The function only depends on $y$

There are two ways to find solutions:
1. *General solution* → Solve the separable differential equation
	- These usua
2. *Stationary solutions* → when $g(y)=0$
	- Think about it: These are valid solutions as well
	- Most likely going to be an undefined point
