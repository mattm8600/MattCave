An Ordinary Differential Equation is **linear** when the variables and their derivatives are *only* multiplied by constants.

Looks like the following form:
## $p(t)\frac{dy}{dt}+q(t)y = r(t)$ ##
Or Linear Normal Form:
## $\frac{dy}{dt} + a(t)y =f(t)$ where $a(t)=\frac{q(t)}{p(t)}$, $f(t)=\frac{r(t)}{p(t)}$

Other notes:
- Differentials must all be multiplied by a constant
- Everything has to be to the first power
- Exception for the time variable $t$

Examples:
### $x^" + x = 0$ is linear 
### $x^"+sin(x) = 0$ is not linear
### $x^" + 2x'+x = sin(t)$ is linear
