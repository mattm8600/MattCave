### Types of Integers:
- Characters
- Short integers
- Integers
- Long integers

Rule about integer sizes: *Long integers are at **least as large** as integers, which are **at least as large** as short integers*
- There is no requirement that long and short integers need to be larger than each other
	– Just can’t be shorter than `short`

### Integer Literals
- Decimal Literals → Just decimal numbers (uses the shortest integer number type)
	– Ex: `123` would be an `int`, or `long` or something
- Octal Literals → Start the integer with `0`
	– Ex: `0173`
- Hexadecimal Literals → Start with `0x`
	– Ex: `0xFFFF`
- Character Literals → Single character inside apostrophes
	– Ex: `'M'` or `'\n'`
