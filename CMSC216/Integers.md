### Types of Integers:
- Characters
- Short integers
- Integers
- Long integers

Rule about integer sizes: *Long integers are at **least as large** as integers, which are **at least as large** as short integers*
- There is no requirement that long and short integers need to be larger than each other
	– Just can’t be shorter than `short`
