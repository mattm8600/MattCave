**Execution** steps:
1. Program is loaded into memory (by OS or via ROM)
2. Code is executed
	- Runtime stack → Local variables per an individual function (or function return)
	- Static Memory → Values retained throughout program’s execution
3. Termination of program
	 Different Causes:
	 - *Normal* → When main function returns or function calls exit
	 - *interruption* → User terminates program, error terminates program
