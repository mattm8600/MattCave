**Multi-Dimensional Arrays** store elements in *row major* order
- Starts at the `arr[0][0]`, go to `arr[0][i]`, then start the next left subscript
- Basically stores each array subscript in a long line

Name of [[C 1D Arrays]] are pointers to the element type
- Array name points to the first array (same as `arr[0]`)
