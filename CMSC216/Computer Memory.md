Computer memory is composed of millions of bits, each holding 0 or 1
- Bits are grouped into **bytes** which are a larger unit of memory
	â€“ Each byte is usually like 32 or 64 bits
- Multiple bytes are grouped into **words** which may store four bytes (for example)

Implementation of where words are stored is not our problem, but we can assume two things:
1. Each location in memory is identified by a unique address
2. Each location in memory contains a value
