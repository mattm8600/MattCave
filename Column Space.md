The **column space** of an $m \times n$ matrix $A$ is the set Col $A$ of all linear combinations of the columns of $A$. It is also a [[Subspace]] of $\mathbb{R}^m$

To test if a vector $\vec b$ is in the column space: Make an augmented Matrix $\begin{bmatrix} A & \vec b \end{bmatrix}$
- Row reduce the column space, see if there is a linear combination that works

Ex:

The pivot columns of a matrix A form a [[Basis]] for the column space of A (un-row reduced version)

### Application to Linear Transformations
The **column space** of a linear transformation is the *range* of the transformation
