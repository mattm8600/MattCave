A **blackbody** is an idealized case of a hot, dense object
- Absorbs all wavelengths of [[Electromagnetic Waves]]

The spectrum that a blackbody emits is called **blackbody radiation**

## $$I = \sigma T^4 $$
$I$ → Intensity of radiation from a blackbody
$\sigma$ → Stefan-Boltzmann Constant = 5.6704E-8

## Wein Displacement Law: $$\lambda_m T = 2.9 \times 10^-3 m \cdot K$$
Total Radiated Intensity:
## $I(\lambda) = \frac{2\pi hc^2}{\lambda^5(e^{hc/\lambda kT}-1)}$
