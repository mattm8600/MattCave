The study of different mirrors and the images they create

### Sign Conventions:
1. Object Distance → $s$ is positive when object is on same side as **incoming** light
2. Image Distance → $s'$ is positive when image is on same side as **outgoing** light 
	– when $s$ is negative it means that the image is **Virtual**
3. Radius → r is positive when center is on **same side** as outgoing light

### Magnification: $$ m = \frac{y'}{y} = \frac{-s'}{s}$$
where $y’$ is image height, $y$ is object height
$m$ > 0 → image is erect
$m$ < 0 → image is inverted

### Cases:
- [[Plane Mirror]]
- [[Concave Mirror]]
- [[Convex Mirror]]
Concave vs Convex Mirrors
| Mirror Type | Radius | Image distance | Image Height |
| ----------- | ------ | -------------- | ------------ |
| Convex      | $-r$   | $-s’$          | $y’$         |
| Concave     | $r$    | $s’$           | $-y’$             |
- [[Converging Lens]]
- [[Diverging Lens]]

### Lensmaker’s Equation: $$\frac{1}{f} = (n-1)(\frac{1}{R_1}-\frac{1}{R_2})$$
where $R_1$ is radius of curvature for first surface, $R_2$ for second

### Cameras:
- Uses an aperture to adjust focal length to make an image in focus
- F-Length: $f$-number $= \frac{f}{D}$ where $D$ is aperture diameter

Intensity is proportional to $D^2/f^2$

## Eyes
- **Myopic** → Near sighted

- **Hyperopic** → Far sighted

Focal Power: $1/f$ where $f$ is focal length (Unit of **Diopters**)

Magnifier:
$M = \theta’ / \theta = 25cm /f$
