#Physics 

An incident photon collides with an electron at rest
- Photon gives part of its energy and momentum to electron
- Scattered photon flies off at an angle with less energy and moment
	â€“ Wavelength of scattered photon gets longer due to collision (see [[Photons]])

### Compton Scattering: $$\lambda' - \lambda = \frac{h}{mc}(1-cos\phi) $$
where $\phi$ is scattering angle
