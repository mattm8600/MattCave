#Physics 

Light can bend corners
	– Edges of shadows aren’t perfectly sharp
[[Interference]] is waves from a small number of sources, while diffraction involves continuous # of waves (lots of interferences at once)

## Single Slit Diffraction:

### Path difference to P: $(a/2)sin\theta$
![[Pasted image 20221216122128.png]]Using small angle approximation $theta = \frac{m\lambda}{a}$ we get:
### $y_m = x \frac{m \lambda}{a}$ (using $y = xtan\theta$)
^ Remember: there is a positive m and -m fringe for each of these, it goes both ways
- Also m **does not equal** zero

Intensity in Single Slit Pattern:
### $I = I_0(\frac{sin(\beta/2)}{\beta/2})^2$ where $\beta = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda} a sin\theta$

Several Slits:
- Constructive Interference : $dsin\theta= m\lambda$
	– Where d is the distance between slits
- Diffraction Grating → Large number of parallel slits

### X-Ray Diffraction:
- You can diffract x-rays through a crystal
Constructive Interference: $2dsin\theta = m\lambda$

Circular Aperture Diffraction (angular radius of Airy Disk):
$sin\theta_1 = 1.22 \frac{\lambda}{D}$
$sin\theta_2 = 2.23\frac{\lambda}{D}$
