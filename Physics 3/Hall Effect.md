When a current-carrying wire is placed in a B Field, there is a sideways force on the electrons
![[Pasted image 20221214232613.png]]
- [[Magnetic Field and Forces]] Tends to push electrons to one side of the wire: resulting in a **potential difference**
	– emf differs in sign based on charge carriers
# $$ nq = \frac{-J_xB_y}{E_z}$$
$n$ → Concentration of mobile charge carriers
$q$ → Charge per carrier
$-J_x$ → Current Density
$B_y$ → Magnetic Field
$Ez$ → Electrostatic field in conductor
