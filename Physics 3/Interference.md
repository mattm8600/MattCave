Interference â†’ When two or more waves overlap in space (principle of superposition)

### Constructive Interference: $P = r_2 - r_1 = m \lambda$

### Destructive Interference: $P = r_2 -r_1 = (m + \frac{1}{2})\lambda$

### Electric Field Interference Pattern:

The resultant electric field wave is dependent on the phase difference
### $E_P = 2E|cos\frac{\phi}{2}|$
The intensity then becomes:
### $I = 4I_0 cos^2(\frac{\phi}{2})$
