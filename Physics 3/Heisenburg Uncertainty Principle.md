#Physics 

You canâ€™t simultaneously know the position and momentum of a [[Photons]], or any particle with great precision
- The more you know of one quantity, the less well you know the other
## $$\Delta x \Delta P_x >= h/{4\pi}$$
There is also an uncertainty principle that involves energy and time:
## $$\Delta t \Delta E >= h/{4 \pi} $$
