Particles in some situations behave like waves

## De Broglie Wavelength
A free particle with rest mass m moving nonrelativistically has a wavelength related to its momentum
### $\lambda = \frac{h}{p} = \frac{h}{mv}$
Has the same energy as a photon: $E = hf$

## Electron Diffraction
You can use the De Broglie wavelength to see how electrons diffract using the relationship between voltage and kinetic energy $eV_{ba} = \frac{p^2}{2m}$

That makes the wavelength of an electron:
### $\lambda = \frac{h}{p} = \frac{h}{\sqrt{2m_eV_{ba}}}$

The wave aspect of electrons can be used to form images like light waves (this is what is used in electron microscopes)
