**Ferromagnetic materials** are strong magnets
	– Consists of lots of small regions (called domains) that act like really small magnets
	– They are aligned, causing them to be magnetic

Unaligned domains reduce magnetization

You can unmagnetize a bar magnet by smacking it really hard or heating it over the Curie Temperature
