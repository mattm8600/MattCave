#Physics 

**Resonance** occurs at frequency $\omega_0$ where current has its maximum
- The out of phase inductor and capacitor cancel each other out
- Occurs at $X_C = X_L$

## $\omega_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}}$

Impedance of AC Circuit Resonance:
# $Z = \sqrt{R^2+(X_L - X_C)^2}$

Quality Factor: $Q = \omega_0 / \Delta \omega = (\omega_0 L)/R$

Power: $P_{avg} = \frac{1}{2} I^2_{peak} R$
