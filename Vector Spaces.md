**Definition** A *Vector Space* is a nonempty set $V$ of vectors which are defined by two operations:
1. Multiplication by scalars
2. Vector addition
And must follow these axioms:
1. The sum of $\vec u + \vec v$ is in $V$
2. $\vec u + \vec v = \vec v + \vec u$
3. There is a zero vector
4. For each $\vec u$ in $V$, there is a vector $-\vec u$ such that $\vec u - \vec u = 0$
5. The scalar multiple of $\vec u$ by $c$ is in $V$
^ There are more, but they are pretty obvious commutative addition and multiplication

Vector Spaces contain an infinite amount of [[Subspace]]s

## Span{}
The **Span** is the set of all possible [[Linear Combinations]] of a set of vector


**Theorem:** If a set of vectors in a vector space $V$ then the span of those vectors is a [[Subspace]] of $V$

Special Vector Spaces:
1. [[Null space]]
2. [[Column Space]]
3. [[Row Space]]
4. [[Eigen Space]]
