**Ceramics** can be ionic or covalent bonds (see [[Ionic Bonds]] and [[Covalent Bonds]])
- The higher the different in electronegativity, the more ionic the ceramic is

Mostly ionic ceramics have ions instead of atoms

Factors that determine crystal structures of ionic ceramics
1. Relative Sizes of ions (to maximize # of oppositely charged ion neighbors)
2. Maintenance of charge neutrality (Net charge should be 0)

### Coordination Number
- Coordination number (for ionic ceramics) is related to atomic radii
## $CN=\frac{r_{cation}}{r_{anion}}$
