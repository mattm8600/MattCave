This section goes more in depth in the arrangement of [[Crystalline Materials]]

**Crystal Structure Definition:** A commonly accepted description of how atoms / ions of crystalline material are arrayed and repeat.

**Coordination Number Definition:** 
## Three Ways to Describe Crystal Structures
1. [[Crystalline Unit Cell]]
2. **Packing**
	- Number and location of **nearest neighbors** (the closest atoms or ions to a given atom/ion)
	- Radius ratio calculations
	- Filling in spaces between ions/atoms in array
3. [[Bravais Space Lattice]]
- Pick and choose these descriptions to best suit your purpose
