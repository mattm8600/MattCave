**Definition of Crystalline:** Atoms that have long range atomic order; materials may be single crystals or polycrystalline (consist of more than one crystal)
- Consists of repeated [[Crystalline Unit Cell]]s

**Non-crystalline** materials have short range atomic order â†’ result of melt, vapor phase, or low T chemical processing

## Crystalline Structures
Crystal Structures are ordered arrangements that:
- Satisfy bonding requirements (Ex: The directions of [[Covalent Bonds]])
- Maximize number per unit volume (Densely, regular packed structures tend to have lower energy)
- Provide electric neutrality if ionic
- Reflect the symmetry of the materials
