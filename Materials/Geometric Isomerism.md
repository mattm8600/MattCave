[[Polymers]] with double bonds between carbon atoms have two different [[Polymer Configurations]]
- Depends on whether side groups are on the same side of the double bonds

## Cis Structure

- Side groups are on the same side of the chain

## Trans Structure

- Side groups are on different sides of the chain

It is impossible to switch between cis and trans structures
- Both give different properties
