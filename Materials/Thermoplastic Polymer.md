**Thermoplastic Polymers** are classified based on their behavior with rising temperatures
- Soften when heated and harden when cooled
- Completely reversible process
- Secondary forces are weaker, so they can be melted and reformed more easily than [[Thermosetting Polymer]]

Most linear and some branched polymers are thermoplastics
