Similar to [[Point Defects in Metals]], there can be vacancies and interstitials
- However, cation and anion vacancies/interstitials have different properties

Due to charge neutrality in ceramics, most defects do not occur alone

### Frankel Defects
When a cation-vacancy and cation-interstitial pair occur

### Schottky Defect
A pair of vacancies - one is cation and the other is anion
![[Pasted image 20230313175538.png]]
- Found in [[AX Type Crystal Structures]]
- Think of removing cation and anion from the internal crystal and putting it externally

NOTE: Both Schottky and Frankel Defects **CANNOT** change the ratio of cations to anions
- Nonstiochometry can occur when there are different ion charges associated with a material
