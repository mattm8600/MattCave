Network polymers that get *permanently* hard on formation and donâ€™t soften during heating
- Have covalent cross-links between molecular chains
- Crosslinking is extensive (10% to 50% are crosslinked)

Generally stronger, harder, and more stability than [[Thermoplastic Polymer]]s

Most crosslinked and network are thermosetting polymers
