There are two main types of point defects: **Vacancies** and **Self-interstitials**

### Vacancies:
A site normally occupied but from which an atom is missing

- All crystalline solids contain vacancies due to the increased entropy they provide

### Self-Interstitials
These are when atoms occupy small void spaces that are normally unfilled

- Interstitial sites introduce large distortions in metals
