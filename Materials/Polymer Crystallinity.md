[[Polymers]] can have crystalline states - Atomic Arrangements are more complex

Most [[Polymers]] are only partially crystalline or noncrystalline
- Any chain disorder or kinks with result in Amorphous (Noncrystalline) region

## Percent Crystallinity
We measure the crystallinity of a polymer with **Percent Crystallinity**
## $PC = \frac{\rho_c(\rho_s-\rho_a)}{\rho_s(\rho_c-\rho_a)}*100$
- $\rho_s$ is the density
