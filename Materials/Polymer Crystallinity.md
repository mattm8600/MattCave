[[Polymers]] can have crystalline states - Atomic Arrangements are more complex

Most [[Polymers]] are only partially crystalline or noncrystalline
- Any chain disorder or kinks with result in Amorphous (Noncrystalline) region

## Percent Crystallinity
We measure the crystallinity of a polymer with **Percent Crystallinity**
## $PC = \frac{\rho_c(\rho_s-\rho_a)}{\rho_s(\rho_c-\rho_a)}*100$
- $\rho_s$ is the density of the specimen
- $\rho_a$ is the density of the amorphous region
- $\rho_c$ is the density of the crystalline region

The degree of crystallinity depends on the rate of cooling and Polymer structure
- Cooling for longer allows chains to get into a more ordered configuration
- Linear polymers are easy to crystallize
- The branches of Branched Polymers made it very difficult to crystallize

Crystalline polymers are usually stringer and more resistant to dissolution and softening by heat
