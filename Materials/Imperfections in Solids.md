At Temperatures above 0K, perfect crystals don’t exist

Important behaviors and [[Material Properties]] depend on imperfections:
- Diffusion
- Mechanical Properties
- Electrical Properties
- Optical Properties

There are different types of impurities in metals:
1. Alloys → When impurity atoms are added intentionally to impart specific characteristics onto material
2. Solid Solutions → Addition of impurity atoms to a metal, creating a solution (like liquid ones but solid)

Terminology:
- *Solvent* → Element that is present in the greatest amount
- *Solute* → Element that is present in the minor concentration

### Solid Solutions
**Solid Solutions** are homogeneous → Defects randomly dispersed throughout the solid
Several features of the solvent and solute determine which dissolves:
- *Atomic Size Factor* → The difference in atomic radii needs to be around $\pm 15$%
- *Crystal Structure* → The crystal structures of both metals need to be the same
- *Electronegativity Factor* → The more electronegative the elements are the more likely they are to create a new compound as opposed to a **solid solution**
- *Valences* → A metal has more a tendency to dissolve into one with a higher valency than lower

Note: Alloys are considered solid solutions

## Alloy Composition
There are two ways to express the composition (aka concentration) of their elements
1. **Weight Percent**
## $C_i = \frac{m_i}{\sum m}*100$
- Sub in the element you want to find the concentration of
2. **Atom Percent**
## $C'_i=\frac{n_{mi}}{\sum n_m}*100$
### where $n_{mi} = \frac{m'_i}{A_i}$
- Basically a mole
