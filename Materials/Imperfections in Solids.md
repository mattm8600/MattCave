At Temperatures above 0K, perfect crystals don’t exist

Important behaviors and [[Material Properties]] depend on imperfections:
- Diffusion
- Mechanical Properties
- Electrical Properties
- Optical Properties

There are different types of impurities in metals:
1. Alloys → When impurity atoms are added intentionally to impart specific characteristics onto material
2. Solid Solutions → Addition of impurity atoms to a metal, creating a solution (like liquid ones but solid)

Terminology:
- *Solvent* → Element that is present in the greatest amount
- *Solute* → Element that is present in the minor concentration

### Solid Solutions
**Solid Solutions** are homogeneous → Defects randomly dispersed throughout the solid
Several features of the solvent and solute determine which dissolves:
- *Atomic Size Factor* → The difference in atomic radii needs to be around $\pm 15$%
- *Crystal Structure* →
