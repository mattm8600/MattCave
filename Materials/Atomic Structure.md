Atomic structure affects almost all material properties

### Units:
amu - atoms or molecules (1/12 the atomic mass of Carbon) = 1g/mol

## Atomic Bonding:

### $E_N=E_A+E_R =-\frac{A}{r}+\frac{B}{r^n}$
- Equilibrium exists at the lowest free energy state
- Called the potential energy well

The shape of the bond energy curve influences the melting point, vaporization point, elastic modulus, and the coefficient of thermal expansion.

Steeper, narrow wells correspond to:
- Higher bond energy
- Higher melting and vaporization point
- Higher Elastic Modulus
- Lower coefficient of thermal expansion
^ These [[Material Properties]] are dependent on bonding

The elastic modulus is the slope of the force 

### CTE
Coefficient of thermal Expansion â†’ How the size of an object changes with change in temperature
# $\frac{x_e-x_0}{x_0}=\alpha \Delta T$
where $\alpha$ is the coefficient of thermal expansion
