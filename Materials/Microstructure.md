For most defects and grains you can only see them using a microscope
Applications:
- Ensure associations between properties, structure, and defects are understood
- Predict the properties of materials once these relationships are established
- Design alloys with new property combinations
- Determine whether material has been correctly heat treated
- Figure out which mechanical failure happened



## Grain Size Determination
- Constituent grains (esp for polycrystalline materials) have a variety of grain shapes and sizes
	– Grain size is usually specified in terms of *average grain diameter*

Two Grain-size determination techniques: (using photomicrographs)
1. Linear Intercept method
	– Draw lines random through photomicrographs
	– Count the grain boundaries intersected by all line segments
	– Calculate **Mean intercept length**
## $\bar l=\frac{L_T}{PM}$ 
Where $L_T$ is the total length of all lines, $P$ is the number of intersections, $M$ is the magnification
2. Comparison Method
	– ATSM made a bunch of grain number charts that you compare your photomicrographs to
	– Then use this relationship to find the **average number of grains per square inch** (at $M=100$)
## $n=2^{G-1}$
If $M$ doesn’t equal 100, use this equation:
### $n_M(\frac{M}{100})^2=2^{G-1}$
where $n_M$ is the number of grains per square inch we are calculating

## Relationship between M.I.L and Grain Number
In mm:
## $G=-6.6457log \bar l - 3.298$
In inches:
## $G=-6.6353log \bar l -12.6$
