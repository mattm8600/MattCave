For most defects and grains you can only see them using a microscope
Applications:
- Ensure associations between properties, structure, and defects are understood
- Predict the properties of materials once these relationships are established
- Design alloys with new property combinations
- Determine whether material has been correctly heat treated
- Figure out which mechanical failure happened



## Grain Size Determination
- Constituent grains (esp for polycrystalline materials) have a variety of grain shapes and sizes
	– Grain size is usually specified in terms of *average grain diameter*

Two Grain-size determination techniques: (using photomicrographs)
1. Linear Intercept method
	– Draw lines random through photomicrographs
	– Count the grain boundaries intersected by all line segments
	– Calculate **Mean intercept length**
## $\bar l=\frac{L_T}{PM}$ 
Where $L_T$ is the total length of all lines, $P$ is the number of intersections, $M$ is the magnification
3.
