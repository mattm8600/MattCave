**Dislocations** are a linear defect where some atoms are misaligned
- Also referred to as edge dislocations ($\bot$) or dislocation lines

- Kind of like a linear interstitial site

## Screw Dislocations
Dislocations caused by a shear stress creating this distortion:

- Almost like a parking garage - just slightly off center with it

## Burgers Vector ($\vec b$)
Expresses the magnitude and direction of the lattice distortion
- The dislocation nature is defined by the angle between Burgers Vector and the dislocation line;
	– Edge dislocation → They are perpendicular
	– Screw dislocation → They are p
