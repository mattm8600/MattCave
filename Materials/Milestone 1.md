Outline:
- Current state of the art for heat plate materials [x]
- Classify their type
- How bonding affects performance
- How structure of materials affects performance
- How application and environment of system influence selection approach
	– What is important to consider
	– How does material structure influence design decisions

**Two Pages** even if pictures are included

Environment:
- High temperatures - Convection, Air Molecules broke apart, collided with vehicle surface, reacting exothermically
	– Orbiter’s surface temperature → Up to 1648 C
- Reusable
- Light weight, low cost
- Smooth Aerodynamic Surface
- Survive loads of launch acoustics, aerodynamic loading, orbit temperature variations
	– Survive pyrotechnic shock loads during State Separation

Ex Materials:
- AVCOAT (silica-phenolic foam)
	– Small hallow plastic balls, mixed with glass fibers, fused together with epoxy
- Silicon tiles on aluminum skin

Aluminum Airframe - Lightweight, good with loading
LI-900 (Silica Glass Fiber) 
	- **TYPE: Silicate Ceramic**
	- Can be heated to 2200 F and plunged in cold water without damage
	- Not suitable for high stress areas
	- Cheap and lightweight
LI-2200
	- **TYPE: Silicate Ceramic**
	- Better strength than LI-900
	- Heavier
FRCI-12 (Amorphous alumino-boro-silicate fiber)
	- Lighter than LI-2200
	- Slightly higher thermal conductivity than LI-900
AETB-8 (FRCI but introduces small quantities of alumina)
	- Increased thermal stability and conductivity
	- No significant effects in strength/weight
