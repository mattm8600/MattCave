My notes for the introduction to Materials Engineering.

Materials Science:
- Investigate relationships between structures and properties of materials
- Create new materials
Materials Engineering:
- Create products from existing materials
- Develop materials processing techniques

## Chapter 1: Introduction
Summary: (L1)
- Material Properties depend on their structures
- Material structures are determined by their processing
- Three classifications of materials: metals, ceramics, polymers
- Six material properties: Mechanical, Electrical, Thermal, Magnetic, Optical, Deteriorative

[[Material Properties]]


## Chapter 2: Atomic Structure and Inter-atomic Bonding
Summary: (L2)
- Chemical, thermal, and optical properties are determined by electronic configuration
- Valence electrons occupy the outermost unfilled electron shell
- Primary bonding types: covalent, ionic, and metallic bonding
- van der Waals bonds are weaker than primary bonding types
- Percent Ionic Character of covalent-ionic mixed bond depends on electronegativity difference

## Chapter 3: Crystal Structures
Summary: L3-L6
- Metals
	– Metallic bonding (free electron cloud)
	– Crystal structure is based on packing a single element
- Ceramics
	– Made of compounds
	– % Ionicity > 20%
	– Nondirectional Bonding, maintains electrical neutrality
