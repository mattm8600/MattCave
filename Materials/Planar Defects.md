There are four main types of planar defects:

## Grain Boundaries
Defects when two different crystal sectors have different grain orientations

- If angle of misalignment is parallel to the grain boundary, a *twist boundary* occurs (an array of screw dislocations)

## Phase Boundaries
When a two-phase 
## Stacking Faults


## External Surfaces
The tendency for materials to reduce their surface area to reduce the overall free energy of the system
- Ex: Water droplets becoming spherical droplets
