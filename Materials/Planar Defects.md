There are four main types of planar defects:

## Grain Boundaries
Defects when two different crystal sectors have different grain orientations

- If angle of misalignment is parallel to the grain boundary, a *twist boundary* occurs (an array of screw dislocations)

## Phase Boundaries
When a two-phase material is in a different phase on either side of the boundary

## Twin Boundaries
A special type of grain boundary where there each grain boundary is the same (found in metals)

Region of material between the different structures is called the **twin**
- Twins result from applied shear forces or during annealing heat treatments

Annealing twins are found in [[FCC Metals]]
Mechanical twins are found in [[BCC Metals]] and [[HCP Metals]]

## External Surfaces
The tendency for materials to reduce their surface area to reduce the overall free energy of the system
- Ex: Water droplets becoming spherical droplets
