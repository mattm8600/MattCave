### Anisotropy:
- Property depends on crystallographic direction of measurement
Ex: The modulus of elasticity on both of these directions aren’t equal

### Isotropy:
- Properties may/may not vary with direction
- If grains are randomly oriented → Properties isotropic
- If grains are textured → Properties Anisotropic
