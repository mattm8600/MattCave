Most polymers are **hydrocarbons** (made of hydrogen and carbon)
- Molecules with double and triple covalent bonds → Unsaturated
- Molecules with only single bonds → Saturated

**Polymers** are long molecules comprised of *repeat units*
- *monomer* → Small molecule from which a polymer is synthesized

**Homopolymers** → All repeating units on chain are of the same type
**Copolymers** → When chains are created from multiple different repeat units
