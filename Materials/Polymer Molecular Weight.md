Not all [[Polymers]] chains are the same length $\therefore$ there is a distribution of molecular weights
There are several ways to define molecular weight:

## Number-Average Molecular Weight
## $\bar M_n = \sum x_iM_i$
- $x_i$ is the fraction of the total number of chains range
- $M_i$ is the mean molecular weight of the size range

## Weight-Average Molecular Weight
## $\bar M_w = \sum w_i M_i$
- $w_i$ is the weight fraction of molecules in the size interval
- $M_i$ is the mean molecular weight in the size interval
