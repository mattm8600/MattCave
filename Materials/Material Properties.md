There are six (main) classes of material properties:
1. Mechanical Properties
	- Ex: The hardness of a material
2. Electrical Properties
	- Ex: Electrical Resistivity
3. Thermal Properties
	- Ex: Thermal Conductivity
4. Optical Properties
	- Light transmittance of some materials depends on their structure
5. Deteriorative Properties
	- Ex: Small cracks forming on a steel bar after wear and tear
