The **Atomic Packing Factor** is the fraction of volume occupied in a crystal structure
## $APF = \frac{V_S}{V_C}$
where
- $V_S$ is the total volume of atoms
- $V_C$ is the total volume of a unit cell

Note: Atom volume can be calculated using the volume of a sphere in terms of atomic radius
- Then you can put the volume in terms of atomic radius as well to find the ratio
