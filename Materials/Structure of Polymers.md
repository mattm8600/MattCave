Polymers are made of molecule chains, but they aren’t always straight or linear

## Linear Polymers
Repeat units are joined together end-to-end in chains

- Might be lots of Van der Waals and hydrogen bonding between chains
- Common Linear Polymers: PVC, Nylon, Fluorocarbons

## Branched Polymers
Similar to linear polymers, but it splits into multiple side branches

- Branches probably result from side reactions during polymer synthesis
- Chain packing efficiency is decreased → Lower density
- Ex: Low-density Polyethylene

## Crosslinked Polymers
Linear chains are joined together using covalent bonds

- Crosslinking is done during synthesis or in a nonreversible reaction
- Most rubbers are crosslinked

## Network Polymers
Polymers connected by a 3D network of (three or more) covalent bonds

- Highly crosslinked polymers can also be classified as network polymers
- Examples: Epoxies, polyurethanes


NOTE: Polymers usually don’t have distinctive structural types
