**Definition:** A region of space through which mass flows
- Useful in analyzing certain parts of smaller systems or a whole system
- Kind of like Gaussian surfaces for mass flow

Example:

We make three Control Volumes (A, B, C) to split the system into three parts:
a. Here we could look at the change of density or mass flow
b. We can look at the mass flow in this section, we can also determine the power from electricity
c. Analyze power going to the motor, from electricity
