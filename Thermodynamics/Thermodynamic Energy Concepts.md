SIGN CONVENTIONS: 
- $W>0$ if done **by** system
- $W < 0$ if done **on** system

## Quasi-Static / Quasi equilibrium Assumption
Not always true but useful for simplifying analysis
- Assume gas expands slowly and controlled
- Assume expansion can be reversed

Work is an **inexact** differential
- This means that work is path dependent andâ€¦
- $W != \int{F ds}$ instead the integral just shows the change between the two states
