There are many different ways to describe these systems:
- Closed → A system in which **no mass** crosses the boundaries of the system
	– Ex: Gas Piston System in combustion engine
	– Note: Energy can move through the boundaries
- Isolated → A system in which **nothing** crosses the boundaries
	– Special case of closed system
- Open → A system in which matter and energy can cross the boundaries
	– Combustion Engine
