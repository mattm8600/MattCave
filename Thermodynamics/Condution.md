**Definition:** The diffusion of thermal energy through a material
![[Pasted image 20230215214142.png]]
- Energetic particles collide with the wall and transfer energy to its atomic layers
- The atomic layers vibrate, transmitting energy to the other side of the wall
- On the right side of the wall low energy particles absorb energy

Heat diffuses through the contact!
