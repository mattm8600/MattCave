Manometers are devices that measure the pressure of an environment
- They used to use differences in fluid height to determine pressure
- Uses a physics concept known as **hydrostatics**

## $\Delta P =\rho g L$
- Derived assuming the net force equals 0 and setting the gravity of the liquid equal to the forces from the pressures
- The difference in pressure is the potential energy of the fluid

A few notes on hydrostatics:
- The lower point in the hydrostatics equation has the higher pressure
- Two points at the same level (of the same liquid) have the same pressure
