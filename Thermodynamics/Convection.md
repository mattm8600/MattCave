**Convection** is heat flow through bulk mass transport

- Areas of a gas or fluid heat or cool greater than their surroundings, causing differences in temperature
- Then other particles replace them, spreading the temperature around

## Mathematical Representation:
## $\dot Q = hA(T_f -T_w)$
where $T_f$ is fluid temperature and $T_w$ is wall temperature
- If $T_f >T_w$ → heat flows into the wall
- If $T_f < T_w$ → Heat flows out of the wall

$h$ is the convection constant with SI units of:
### $[W/{m^2*K}]$

Convection constant depends on wall/fluid properties and flow properties
