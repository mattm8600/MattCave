Remember: [[Thermodynamics]] is the subset of physics that studies the relation of heat, energy, and work

Reminder of some definitions:
- Energy → The capacity to do work transferred between two objects (Extensive Property)
- Heat → Form of energy that can be transferred between two objects as a result of difference in temperature
- Temperature → The measure of the average kinetic energy within a medium (Intensive Property)
- Work → The energy of a system that is transferred to its surroundings
