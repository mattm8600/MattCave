When we use [[Hydrostatics]] we are finding the **Gauge Pressure**
- This is different from the actual **vacuum pressure**

### Difference between Gauge and Vacuum Pressure
- Gauge pressure uses atmospheric pressure as its zero point
	â€“ Looking at the difference between two pressures wrt atmospheric
- Vacuum pressure has absolute zero as its zero point

therefore
## $P_{Gauge} = P_{tank} - P_{atm}$
- **Add the atmospheric pressure to gauge pressure** to get the absolute pressure
