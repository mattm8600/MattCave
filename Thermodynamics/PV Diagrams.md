**PV Diagrams** are a good way to visualize the relationship between pressure and volume
- Looks at changes between states as pressure or volume changes

The area under a curve of a PV diagram can give us the work

### Polytropic Processes
A reversible compression / expansion process for ideal gases that follows the form
## $PV^n = c$
where $c$ is the polytropic constant

## Different Types of Expansion
1. Isothermal Expansion → Temperature is kept constant (n = 1)
2. Isobaric Expansion → Pressure is kept constant (n=0)
3. Isochoric Expansion → Volume is kept constant, net work is 0

Ex:

- Process 1→ 2 : Isobaric Process (Negative work)
- Process 2 → 3 : Isochoric Process (0 work)
- Process 3 → 1 : Polytropic Process (Positive work) ← Integrate the polytropic process equation
