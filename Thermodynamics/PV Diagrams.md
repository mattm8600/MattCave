**PV Diagrams** are a good way to visualize the relationship between pressure and volume
- Looks at changes between states as pressure or volume changes

The area under a curve of a PV diagram can give us the work

### Poly tropic Processes
A reversible compression / expansion process for ideal gases that follows the form
## $PV^n = c$
where $c$ is the polyropic constant
