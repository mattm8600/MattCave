**Cycles** → Begin and end at the same thermodynamic state
- Use the [[First Law of Thermodynamics]] except that $\Delta E = 0$
	– Therefore $Q_{cycle} = W_{cycle}$

## Power Cycle
Generates power by transferring energy from hot to cold reservoirs
![[Pasted image 20230215222842.png]]
- Positive net work
### $W_{cycle} = Q_{in} - Q_{out}$
^ This is derived from the first law of thermodynamics

Power Cycle Efficiency:
### $\frac{W_{out}}{Q_{in}} = \frac{Q_{in}-Q_{out}}{Q_{in}} = 1 - \frac{Q_{in}}{Q_{out}}$

## Refrigeration Cycle
Facilitates heat flow (from cold to hot reservoir) using external work
![[Pasted image 20230215223454.png]]
- Negative net work
## $W_{cycle} = Q_{out}-Q_{in}$
- $Q_{in}$ → Heat into the system **FROM** the cold Bowdy
- $Q_{out}$ → Heat out of the system **INTO** the hot body (Ex: Could be environment)
- The work is being done on the system to reverse heat flow
## $Q_{in} - Q_{out} = -W_{cycle}$

Efficiency of refrigerator cycle:
## $\beta = \frac{Q_{in}}{{Q_{out}-Q_{in}}}$

Efficiency of heat pump cycle:
## $\gamma = \frac{Q_{out}}{{Q_{out}-Q_{in}}}$
