**Cycles** → Begin and end at the same thermodynamic state
- Use the [[First Law of Thermodynamics]] except that $\Delta E = 0$
	– Therefore $Q_{cycle} = W_{cycle}$

## Power Cycle
Generates power by transferring energy from hot to cold reservoirs

- Positive net work
### $W_{cycle} = Q_{in} - Q_{out}$
^ This is derived from the first law of thermodynamics

Power Cycle Efficiency:
### $\frac{W_{out}}{Q_{in}} = \frac{Q_{in}-Q_{out}}{Q_{in}} = 1 - \frac{Q_{in}}{Q_{out}}$

## Refrigeration Cycle
Facilitates heat flow (from cold to hot reservoir) using external work

- Negative net work
