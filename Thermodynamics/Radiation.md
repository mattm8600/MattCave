**Radiation** is heat that transfers freely into the environment as a result of an object’s energy
- Higher temperature generally means longer wavelength emissions
	– This is what we feel as heat

## Mathematical Representation
## $\dot Q = \epsilon\sigma A(T_w^4-T_E^4)$
- $\sigma$ is Stefan-Boltzmann Constant $5.67E-8 [\frac{W}{m^2*K^4}]$
- $T_w$ is the surface temperature
- $T_E$ is the environment temperature
- $A$ is the surface area
