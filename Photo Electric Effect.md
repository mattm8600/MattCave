Electrons can escape from a surface where [[Photons]] hit it and the energy overcomes the attraction of positive ions

The electron can escape from the surface **only** if the energy is greater than the **work function**: $\phi$
- The greater the work function, the higher frequency needed to emit photoelectrons

### Energy Conservation : $E = hf = KE_{electron} + \phi$

**Stopping Potential:** The voltage difference required to stop electrons from moving across metal plates in photoelectric effect

### $eV_0 = hf - \phi$
