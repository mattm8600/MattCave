Cathode â†’ Emits electrons

Electrons are emitted from a heated cathode towards an anode. When they strike it, x-rays are produced
- The greater the KE of electrons striking the anode, the shorter the minimum wavelength of x-rays
- Higher-energy electrons convert their energy into higher-energy photons with a shorter wavelength
