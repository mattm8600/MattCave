# $A \vec x = \vec b$
where $A$ is an $n \times m$ matrix of weights and $\vec x$ is the variables to solve for
^ This is just [[Linear Combinations]] using $A$ as weights

The **Matrix Equation** only has a solution if $\vec b$ is a linear combination of the columns of $\vec b$

## Linear System Solutions
**Homogeneous Solution** → only the trivial solution
	– $A \vec x = 0$ is called the **trivial solution**
**Non-homogeneous Solution** → At least one non-trivial solution
	– A **non-trivial** solution is when there is at least one free variable

- Since there is a $\vec v$ that does NOT equal 0
