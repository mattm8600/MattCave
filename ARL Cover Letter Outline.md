# Outline
**Projects I’m interested in:**
Multi-agent collaborative systems
- I’ve read several papers on multi-agent systems
- I have background knowledge on different drone metareasoning systems (auction model, supervisor model, etc)
- I find this problem the most interesting as autonomous robots working together has a ton of potential
UAV Vision
- I enjoy working with physical robots / have experience setting up a Clearpath Jackal
- I find the maneuvering to get more information component fascinating
- Really interested in the implementation of ML (is a very practical skill)
Aerial Perception
- I have experience with ROS
- I took a dynamics class already, haven’t taken either of the other classes
- I find this problem super cool and while I haven’t learned all the components in class I would be willing to work extra hard to get the background I need

**Education:**
- I’ve taken many mechanical engineering and computer science classes
- In my introduction to Engineering we built a ground robot from scratch
	– I programmed the robot to navigate an arena and to measure the height of a block
- I also completed some of MIT 6.S191 deep learning class
	– Made a recursive neural network that used a large dataset of irish folk music that given a note could predict the next one

**Work Experience:**
- Last summer I worked as an intern under Dr. Herrmann on ARL Contract W911NF2120076
- We modified the Phoenix Ground Autonomy Stack to run multiple navigation algorithms at once
- When the navigation algorithm failed, we changed it to a functional algorithm
- Designed an experiment, found that our algorithm reduced failure by 20% compared to unaltered stack
- Wrote a technical report (pending publication)
- I am very familiar with the Phoenix Autonomy Stack
- I can use ROS proficiently in Python and C++
- Got experience integrating and setting up the stack with a Clearpath Jackal
- Learned how to work within ARL systems

## Interests
- I’m a maker, learner, and good person
	–  I love to design and make things: woodworking, music, robots
	– I’m always curious and trying to learn how the world works - especially in the fields of robotics, physics, economics, and cars
	– I think of myself as a person who cares about others and works well in a team
- I’m a quick learner whos best skill is learning on the fly

## Projects
Right now I am working on several projects:
- I recently got into woodworking, so I’m working on two woodworking projects right now
- I am building a shelf-box combination for my friend for Christmas
- I am building a corn hole set for my friends at school
- I build them both out of wood, I’m still working on finishing and painting them both
- My long-term project is a fully autonomous ground robot out of spare parts
	– I bought a 2D lidar and IMU that I plan to use with my Raspberry Pi 3
	– My 3D Printer at home broke, so I’m still working on putting together the physical robot and the electronics
	– I plan to make it capable of mapping an unknown environment and then navigating autonomously to waypoints

## Statement of Goals
I have two goals for the summer: 
- I want to get more experience with physical robots, preferably testing what I make on a physical platform
- I want to get more experience in either robot navigation or perception
- Any experience in multi robot problems would be super cool and fascinating to work on

## Closing
- I am really excited for this opportunity to provide value to the Army, while developing my robotics skills
- If there are any questions email me at mueller1436@gmail.com
