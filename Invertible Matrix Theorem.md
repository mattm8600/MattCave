5. The columns of $A$ form a linearly independent set
6. The linear transformation $T(x) = A\vec x$ is *one-to-one*
7. The equation $A\vec x = \vec b$ has at least one solution for each $\vec b$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$
8. The columns of A span $\mathbb{R}^n$
9. The linear transformation $T(\vec x) = A\vec x$ maps $\mathbb{R}^n$ to $\mathbb{R}^n$
