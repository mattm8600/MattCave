**Big-O:** Upper Bound on the amount of work

**Big-Omega:** Lower Bound on the amount of work

### Case Analysis
**Best Case:** The smallest number of operations that an algorithm requires

**Worst Case:** Worst case is the largest number of operations required to perform an algorithm

**Average Case:** # of operations required for a typical case
- Two ways to computer:
	– Average case → average of all possible cases assuming they have the same probability
	– Expected case → weighted average of all cases using probability

**Amortized Cost:** Find average running time per operation of worst-case sequence operations


### Complexity Categories:
**Polynomial Time:** $O(n), O(nlog(n)), O(n^3)$
**Exponential Time:** $O(2^n), O(n!), O(n^n)$

**Nondeterministic Polynomial Time:** Not proved whether problem can only be solved in either polynomial time or exponential time

**Decidable:** Can be solved by an algorithm
**Undecidable:** Cannot be solved by an algorithm
